#What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server, rather than just in the browser. Node.js is designed to be efficient and asynchronous, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications.

#Event loop
The event loop is a core concept in Node.js. It's responsible for handling asynchronous operations, allowing multiple operations to occur concurrently without 
blocking the main thread.
