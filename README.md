# node-basics

Welcome to the `node-basics` repository! This repository is designed to help you understand the basics of Node.js and its core concepts.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine developed by Google. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server, rather than just in the browser. Node.js is designed to be efficient and asynchronous, making it well-suited for building scalable and high-performance applications.

## Why Node.js?

- Superfast and highly scalable.
- Large ecosystem of open-source libraries.
- Fast response time for applications.

## Modules

Node.js provides various built-in modules that you can use to enhance your applications. Some of these include:

- OS
- PATH
- FS (File System)
- HTTP

## Event Loop

The event loop is a core concept in Node.js. It's responsible for handling asynchronous operations, allowing multiple operations to occur concurrently without blocking the main thread. For a detailed understanding of the event loop, check out this highly recommended video: [Event Loop Explanation](https://youtu.be/L18RHG2DwwA).

## Global Objects

Node.js comes with a set of global objects that provide essential functionalities. Some of these include:

- `__dirname`
- `__filename`
- `exports`
- `module`
- `require()`
